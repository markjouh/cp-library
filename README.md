My library of template code for competitive programming.

## Notes
* Inclusive intervals and 0-indexing for all interfaces.
* Templates use features up to C++17, local utilities are unrestricted and might use very new features.
* Templates are tested with [verification helper](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/verification-helper) using the solutions in [verify](verify) (which also serve as usage examples).
